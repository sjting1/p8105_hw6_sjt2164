## Problem 1

```{r weather}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

```{r summary, include=FALSE}
weather_df
#365 observations, 6 variables
#chr: name, id = Central Park data only
#date: date = 2017 data from Jan 1st to Dec 31st.
#dbl: prcp, tmax, tmin

summary(weather_df)
#no NAs for pcrp, tmax, tmin
```

_Prompt_

* `tmax` as the response 
* `tmin` as the predictor
* interested in distribution of two quantities estimated from:
  * 𝑟̂ 2
  * log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1)
  
* Use 5000 bootstrap samples
* For each bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities. 
* Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words. 

* Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for 𝑟̂ 2 and log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1)
* Use broom::glance() for extracting 𝑟̂ 2 from a fitted regression
* Use broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) to compute log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1)


## Problem 2: Homicides in 50 large U.S. cities 

```{r Homicide data}
#Import from github repo, read article.
```

* Create a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved (ex. `solved`: y/n)

* Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO (they don’t report victim race) 
* Omit Tulsa, AL (is a data entry mistake)
* Limit your analysis to those for whom `victim_race` is `white` or `black`. 
* Be sure that `victim_age` is numeric.

_*_Baltimore, MD_

* For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `glm` function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors. 
* Save output of `glm` as an R object; apply the `broom::tidy` to this object
* Obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.

_Glm for the Cities_

* Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset
* Extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims. 
* Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of `purrr::map`, list columns, and `unnest` as necessary to create a dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

*Plot*

```{r plot}

```

* Shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city on plot
* Organize cities according to estimated OR
* Comment on the plot
