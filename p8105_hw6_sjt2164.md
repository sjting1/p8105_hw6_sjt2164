## Problem 1

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```

*Prompt*

- `tmax` as the response

- `tmin` as the predictor

- interested in distribution of two quantities estimated from:

  - 𝑟̂ 2
  - log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1)

- Use 5000 bootstrap samples

- For each bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities.

- Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words.

- Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5%
  quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for 𝑟̂ 2 and log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂
  1)

- Use broom::glance() for extracting 𝑟̂ 2 from a fitted regression

- Use broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) to compute log(𝛽̂
  0∗𝛽̂ 1)

## Problem 2: Homicides in 50 large U.S. cities

``` r
#Import from github repo, read article.
```

- Create a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary
  variable indicating whether the homicide is solved (ex. `solved`: y/n)

- Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO (they don’t
  report victim race)

- Omit Tulsa, AL (is a data entry mistake)

- Limit your analysis to those for whom `victim_race` is `white` or
  `black`.

- Be sure that `victim_age` is numeric.

\_\**Baltimore, MD*

- For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the `glm` function to fit a
  logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and
  victim age, sex and race as predictors.
- Save output of `glm` as an R object; apply the `broom::tidy` to this
  object
- Obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio
  for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping
  all other variables fixed.

*Glm for the Cities*

- Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset
- Extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides
  comparing male victims to female victims.
- Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of `purrr::map`, list
  columns, and `unnest` as necessary to create a dataframe with
  estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

*Plot*

- Shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city on plot
- Organize cities according to estimated OR
- Comment on the plot
