Serena (sjt2164)

This homework uses the `tidyverse` library with `set.set(1)` for
reproducibility.

## Problem 1

``` r
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())

``` r
#Central Park data for year 2017 with info on precipitation, max and min temp
```

- For each boostrap sample, interested in distribution of :
  - 𝑟̂ 2
  - log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1)

``` r
Bootstrap = weather_df |> 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 5000) |> #5000 bootstrap samples 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, \(df) lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = df) ), # y = tmax, x = tmin
    results = map(models, broom::tidy), #for log betas
    r_squared = map(models, broom::glance)) |> #shows R^2
   # log_betas = log(intercept * 
  unnest(results, r_squared) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(id, term, estimate, r_squared) |>
   mutate(
    term = ifelse(term == "(Intercept)", "intercept", term)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "term", 
    values_from = "estimate") |>
  mutate(
    log_beta0xbeta1 = log(intercept * tmin)) |> #log of the product of beta0 and beta1
  select(id, r_squared, log_beta0xbeta1)
```

    ## Warning: `unnest()` has a new interface. See `?unnest` for details.
    ## ℹ Try `df %>% unnest(c(results, r_squared))`, with `mutate()` if needed.

##### Distribution of 𝑟̂ 2 estimates

``` r
Bootstrap |>
  ggplot(aes(x = id, y = r_squared)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "R squared distribution for 5000 bootstrap samples",
       x = "Boostrap Sample Id",
       y = "R squared") 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw6_sjt2164_files/figure-gfm/estimate%20plots-1.png)<!-- -->

##### Distribution of log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1) estimates

``` r
Bootstrap |>
  ggplot(aes(x = id, y = log_beta0xbeta1)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Log(beta0 * beta1) distribution for 5000 bootstrap samples",
       x = "Boostrap Sample Id",
       y = "Log(beta0 * beta1") 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

![](p8105_hw6_sjt2164_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

Both plots indicate an uniformly distribution of the estimates. The
distribution of the R squared estimates has a higher density around 0.90
and 0.92. In comparison, the log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ distribution is more concentrated
between 2.00 and 2.05.

##### Confidence Intervals

``` r
CI_estimates = Bootstrap |> 
  summarize(
    R2_ci_lower = quantile(r_squared, 0.025), 
    R2_ci_upper = quantile(r_squared, 0.975),
    logBetas_ci_lower = quantile(log_beta0xbeta1, 0.025), 
    logBetas_ci_upper = quantile(log_beta0xbeta1, 0.975)) 

CI_estimates
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   R2_ci_lower R2_ci_upper logBetas_ci_lower logBetas_ci_upper
    ##         <dbl>       <dbl>             <dbl>             <dbl>
    ## 1       0.894       0.927              1.96              2.06

Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, we find that the 95% confidence
interval for 𝑟̂ 2 is (0.894, 0.927).

The 95% confidence interval for log(𝛽̂ 0∗𝛽̂ 1) is (1.964, 2.059).

**Raw Data** The raw data `homicide` has 52179 observations and 12
variables.

- Identity variables include
  - `uid` (52179),
  - Name of victim (`victim_first` and `victim_last`)
  - `victim_race` (Hispanic, White, Other, Black, Asian, and Unknown),
  - `victim_age` (includes Unknown)
  - `victim_sex` (Male, Female, Unknown)
- Date variable includes `reported_date` in the format YYYYMMDD. 2
  entries does not follow this format (has an extra number).
- Location variables include `city` (50), `state`, latitude (`lat`), and
  longitude (`lon`).
- The last variable is `disposition` (3 categories)

**Data Cleaning**

- Fixed two `reported_date` entries that had an extra number
- Fixed abbreviation for Wisconsin
- created new `city_state` variable
- Created a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”)
- Created a binary variable `homicide_solved` indicating whether the
  homicide is solved (yes vs. no)
- Ensured `victim_age` is numeric
- Omited cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO (they don’t
  report victim race)
- Omited Tulsa, AL (is a data entry mistake)
- Limit your analysis to those for whom `victim_race` is `white` or
  `black`.

``` r

    reported_date = case_match(reported_date,

\_\**Baltimore, MD*

- For the city of Baltimore, MD, the `glm` function is used to fit a
  logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and
  victim age, sex and race as predictors.
  - Output of `glm` is saved as a csv file (Baltimore_glm.csv) and
    `broom::tidy` was applied to this object

``` r

**MODEL**

homicide_solved = -0.007(victim_age) + 0.854(victim_sexFemale) -
0.842(victim_raceBlack) + 0.297

Reference = Male, White

Comparing solved vs. unsolved homicides

Based on the output, the OR estimate and its 95% confidence interval for
solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all
other variables fixed.

``` r
# homicide_solved = 1 = solved
```

*Glm for the Cities*

- Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset
- Extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides
  comparing male victims to female victims.
- Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of `purrr::map`, list
  columns, and `unnest` as necessary to create a dataframe with
  estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

*Plot*

- Shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city on plot
- Organize cities according to estimated OR
- Comment on the plot

## Problem 3: Effects of variables on a child’s birthweight

``` r
bwt_df = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv", na = c("NA", ".", ""))

    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
#4342 observations, 20 variables
```

Dataset has ~4000 children and includes the following variables:

- `babysex`: baby’s sex (male = 1, female = 2)
- `bhead`: baby’s head circumference at birth (centimeters)
- `blength`: baby’s length at birth (centimeteres)
- `bwt`: baby’s birth weight (grams)
- `delwt`: mother’s weight at delivery (pounds)
- `fincome`: family monthly income (in hundreds, rounded)
- `frace`: father’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto
  Rican, 8 = Other, 9 = Unknown)
- `gaweeks`: gestational age in weeks
- `malform`: presence of malformations that could affect weight (0 =
  absent, 1 = present)
- `menarche`: mother’s age at menarche (years)
- `mheigth`: mother’s height (inches)
- `momage`: mother’s age at delivery (years)
- `mrace`: mother’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto
  Rican, 8 = Other)
- `parity`: number of live births prior to this pregnancy
- `pnumlbw`: previous number of low birth weight babies
- `pnumgsa`: number of prior small for gestational age babies
- `ppbmi`: mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI
- `ppwt`: mother’s pre-pregnancy weight (pounds)
- `smoken`: average number of cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy
- wtgain\`: mother’s weight gain during pregnancy (pounds)

#### Data Cleaning

``` r
#clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).
```

#### Regression Model

Propose a regression model for birthweight. \* Model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two. \*
Describe modeling process

- Show a plot of model residuals against fitted values – use
  `add_predictions` and `add_residuals` in making this plot.

#### Compare your model to two others:

- One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
  effects only)

- One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
  (including the three-way interaction) between these

Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error;
use `crossv_mc` and functions in `purrr` as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”.
